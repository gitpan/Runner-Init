=head1 NAME

Runner::Threads

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=cut

our $VERSION = '1.6';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Use Parallel::ForkManager to run arbitrary bash commands

=head1 Variables

=cut

=head2 twait

How frequently to test for a thread having exited the queue in seconds. Defaults to once every 60 seconds. If your jobs are very fast, you may want to decrease this number, or vice versa if they are very long.

=cut

has 'twait' => (
    is => 'rw', 
    isa => 'Int',
    lazy => 1,
    required => 1,
    default => 60,
    documentation => q{How frequently to test for a thread having exited the queue in seconds. Defaults to once every 60 seconds.}
);

=head2 threads

This uses Parallel::ForkManager to deploy the threads. If you wish to use something else you must redefine it here.

=cut

has 'threads' => (
    traits  => ['NoGetopt'],
    is => 'rw',
    lazy => 1,
    default => sub {
        my $self = shift;
        return new Parallel::ForkManager($self->procs); 
    }
);

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=cut

=head2 go

This is the main application. It starts the logging, build the threads, parses the file, runs the commands, and finishes logging.

=cut

sub go {
    my $self = shift;

    my $dt1 = DateTime->now();

    $self->prepend_logfile("MAIN_");
    $self->log($self->init_log);

    #Threads specific
    build_threads($self);

    $self->parse_file_threads;
    #End threads specific

    my $dt2 = DateTime->now();
    my $duration = $dt2 - $dt1;
    my $format = DateTime::Format::Duration->new(
        pattern => '%Y years, %m months, %e days, %H hours, %M minutes, %S seconds'
    );

    $self->log->info("Total execution time ".$format->format_duration($duration));
}

=head2 parse_file_threads

Parse the file of commands and send each command off to the queue.

=cut

#TODO
#Merge mce/threads subroutines

sub parse_file_threads{
    my $self = shift;

    my $fh = IO::File->new( $self->infile, q{<} ) or $self->log->fatal("Error opening file  ".$self->infile."  ".$!); # even better!

    my $cmd;
    while(<$fh>){
        my $line = $_;
        next unless $line;
        next unless $line =~ m/\S/;
        next if $line =~ m/^#/;

        if($self->has_cmd){
            $self->add_cmd($line);
            if($line =~ m/\\$/){
                next;
            }
            else{
                $self->log->info("Enqueuing command:\n".$self->cmd);
                $self->run_command_threads;
                $self->clear_cmd;
                $self->inc_counter; 
            }
        }
        else{
            $self->cmd($line);
            if($line =~ m/\\$/){
                next;
            }
            elsif( $self->match_cmd("wait") ){
                $self->log->info("Beginning command:\n".$self->cmd);
                $self->log->info("Waiting for all children to exit...");
                $self->clear_cmd;
                $self->threads->wait_all_children;
                $self->log->info("All children are out of the pool!");
                $self->inc_counter; 

            }
            else{
                $self->log->info("Enqueuing command:\n".$self->cmd);
                $self->run_command_threads;
                $self->clear_cmd;
                $self->inc_counter; 
            }
        }
    }

    $self->threads->wait_all_children;

}

=head2 build_threads

This is the command to build the threads. To change this just add a build_threads method in your script.

    $self->threads->run_on_wait(
        sub {
            $self->log->debug("** Queue full. Waiting for one process to end ...");
        },
        $self->twait,
    );

or

    package Main;
    extends 'Runner::Threads';

    sub build_threads {

        $self->threads->run_on_wait(
            sub {
                $self->log->debug("** This is my custom message");
            },
            $self->twait,
        );
    }

=cut

sub build_threads{
    my $self = shift;

    $self->threads->run_on_wait(
        sub {
            $self->log->debug("** Queue full. Waiting for one process to end ...");
        },
        $self->twait,
    );
}
